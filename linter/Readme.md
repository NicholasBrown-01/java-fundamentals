# Lab03 Linter Portion

Methods:

- File I/O

Came back to this lab to correct file structure, update code, build tests for errors.

What a great experience getting to dig back through and implement tests now that I understand them a little better.

The JS file to be scanned is already brought into the method. In the AppTest.java there are a couple tests that will check to ensure the program is finding at least 1 error in that file, as well as finding the total amount of error possible in the file.

I did still have use GPT to help with String testing but overall it went smoothly!
